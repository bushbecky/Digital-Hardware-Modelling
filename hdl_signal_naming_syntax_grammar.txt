signal_attributes ::= class_char [ signal_waveform ] state_char three-state_mode active-low_char io_mode

class_char ::= "R" | "A" | "C" | "S" | "D" | "T"
"R" ::= Reset signal [Red]
"A" ::= Any other signal subject to asynchronous switching [Orange]
"C" ::= Clock signal [Green]
"S" ::= Status or control signal [Blue]
"D" ::= Data, Address Signal [Black]
"T" ::= Test Signal [Yellow]

signal_waveform ::= "Q" | "M" | "G"
"Q" ::= Clock Qualified Signalling (Default Signalling within a clock domain)
"M" ::= Impulse Signalling (Mark)
"G" ::= Transition Signalling (Grade)

state_char ::= "N" | "P" | ""
"N" ::= Next State Signal
