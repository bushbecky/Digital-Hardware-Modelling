AME
       TRANS-4  (warning)  Target library contains no replacement for register
       '%s' (%s).


DESCRIPTION
       The named register could not be  translated  into  the  target_library.
       The  most  likely  reason  is that no cell exists in the target_library
       that matches  the  asynchronous  requirements  of  the  original  cell.
       Another  possible  reason is that the target_library contains no regis-
       ters, or has not been sequentially modeled.  The register is left as  a
       generic flip-flop (**FFGEN**).


WHAT NEXT
       Add  a  correctly-modeled sequential element to the target_library with
       the same asynchronous requirements as the cell that was not translated.

NAME
       LINT-28  (warning)  In  design  '%s', port '%s' is not connected to any
       nets.


DESCRIPTION
       This warning alerts you that a port in a design is not connected to any
       nets.   This  usually  indicates  that  a design has not been correctly
       specified. However, there are some situations where, as a designer, you
       choose  to  specify  a port on a design for compatibility reasons, even
       though the port is not internal to  design  use.   The  Synopsys  tools
       leave  unconnected ports alone, with one exception; that is, you speci-
       fied that a given input port is opposite or equal to another input port
       in a design.


WHAT_NEXT
       Make  sure  that  you want the named port to exist in the given design,
       even though it has no nets connected.  Remove the port from your design
       if you choose.
